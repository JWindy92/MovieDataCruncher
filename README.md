### Basic Service Description

1. **Data Ingestion Service** (Go):
   - Go is well-suited for building efficient and concurrent services. You can use it to create a service that fetches IMDb data from various sources, processes it, and stores it in an SQLite database.
   - Libraries: Consider using the `github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql` library for interacting with SQLite databases, and `github.com/PuerkitoBio/goquery` for web scraping IMDb data.

2. **Data Transformation Service** (Go):
   - Go is suitable for data transformation tasks, especially when dealing with large datasets. You can use it to clean, structure, and preprocess IMDb data before storing it in an SQLite database.
   - Libraries: Utilize the standard Go libraries for data manipulation and text processing.

3. **Analysis Service** (Julia):
   - Julia is an excellent choice for data analysis and scientific computing due to its high performance. You can use Julia to perform complex data analysis tasks on the IMDb dataset.
   - Libraries: Julia has various libraries for data analysis, including `DataFrames.jl` for working with tabular data, `Plots.jl` for data visualization, and `TextAnalysis.jl` for natural language processing (NLP) tasks like sentiment analysis on user reviews.

4. **Prediction Service** (Julia):
   - Julia's speed and numerical computing capabilities make it suitable for implementing machine learning models and making predictions based on IMDb data.
   - Libraries: Consider using `ScikitLearn.jl` for machine learning, `Flux.jl` for neural networks, and `MLJ.jl` for machine learning pipelines in Julia.

5. **Recommendation Service** (Go and Julia):
   - Go can be used to build the recommendation service API, while Julia can handle the recommendation algorithm's backend processing.
   - Libraries: Use Go for creating the API with libraries like `github.com/gin-gonic/gin` for web services and Julia for recommendation algorithms.

6. **API Gateway** (Go):
   - Go is a suitable language for building API gateways, as it can efficiently handle HTTP requests and routing.
   - Libraries: You can use the standard `net/http` package for building the API gateway, and `github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter` for efficient routing.

7. **SQLite Databases** (Go):
   - Go has excellent support for working with SQLite databases, so you can use it for interacting with SQLite databases in all microservices.
   - Libraries: Use the `github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3` package for interacting with SQLite databases in Go.


### Distributed SQLite Database Plan

1. **Raw Data Database**: This SQLite database is used for temporary storage of raw IMDb data fetched from various sources. It may have tables for storing movie details, cast information, and user reviews. The database could be named something like "raw_imdb_data.db."
Data Transformation Service (Go):

2. **Cleaned Data Database**: This SQLite database is used to store the cleaned and transformed IMDb data after processing by the Data Transformation Service. It might have tables for movies, actors, genres, and other structured data. The database could be named something like "imdb_cleaned_data.db."
Analysis Service (Julia):

3. **Analysis Results Database**: Julia can interact with this SQLite database to store intermediate analysis results and metadata. Tables may include sentiment analysis scores, genre trends, actor popularity rankings, and other relevant analytics. The database could be named something like "imdb_analysis_results.db."
4. **Prediction Service (Julia):**

    - **Model Parameters Database**: This SQLite database can store machine learning model parameters and configurations used for predictions. Tables might include model names, hyperparameters, and serialized model objects. The database could be named something like "model_parameters.db."

    - **Prediction Results Database**: After making predictions, the service can store the results in this SQLite database. It might include tables for movie ratings, box office predictions, or user preferences. The database could be named something like "prediction_results.db."

5. **Recommendation Service (Go and Julia)**:

    - **User Profiles Database**: Go can manage user profiles and preferences in this SQLite database, storing information like user IDs, movie preferences, and viewing history. The database could be named something like "user_profiles.db."

    - **Recommendation Results Database**: Julia can use this SQLite database to store movie recommendations for each user. Tables may include user recommendations and movie IDs. The database could be named something like "recommendation_results.db."

6. **API Gateway (Go)**: The API Gateway service may not have its own SQLite database but can interact with other service databases as needed to fulfill API requests.

7. **SQLite Databases in Other Microservices (Go)**: Each microservice can have its SQLite database for managing its specific data. For example, the Data Ingestion Service may have a "raw_imdb_data.db," the Data Transformation Service may have an "imdb_cleaned_data.db," and so on.


### Redis Integration

1. **Caching IMDb Data**:
   - Redis can be used to cache frequently accessed IMDb data, such as movie details, cast information, and user reviews. Caching can reduce the load on the SQLite databases and speed up data retrieval for services like the Recommendation Service and API Gateway.

2. **Session Management**:
   - If your application has user sessions, Redis can be used to store session data. This can help manage user authentication tokens, user preferences, and other session-related information efficiently.

3. **Real-time Notifications**:
   - For features like real-time notifications (e.g., new movie recommendations or updates on user reviews), Redis can be used as a message broker. Services can publish updates to Redis, and subscribers can receive real-time notifications.

4. **Rate Limiting and Throttling**:
   - Redis can be employed to implement rate limiting and request throttling mechanisms in the API Gateway. This can help protect your services from excessive traffic and abuse.

5. **Background Job Queues**:
   - If you have long-running or background tasks, Redis can serve as a message queue to manage job scheduling and processing. Services like the Data Transformation Service or Analysis Service can use Redis to queue and process tasks asynchronously.

6. **Temporary Data Storage**:
   - Redis can be used to store temporary data structures like sets, lists, and sorted sets. This can be useful for managing transient data during data transformations, analytics, or recommendation calculations.

7. **Caching Machine Learning Model Predictions**:
   - In the Prediction Service, you can cache the results of machine learning model predictions in Redis. This can help serve frequent prediction requests faster and reduce the computational load on the models.

8. **User Activity Tracking**:
   - Redis can store user activity data in real-time, allowing you to track user behavior, monitor user interactions, and generate analytics on the fly.

9. **Distributed Locks**:
   - Redis provides support for distributed locks, which can be useful for ensuring data consistency and coordination across microservices when needed.
